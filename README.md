# Snake Client Project

#### *Created by Gareth Carey*

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

## Final Product

This game will allow you to connect to the game server and control the snake as you move around the screen using W, A, S and D keys on your keyboard. The aim of the game is to eat as many dots on the screen without hittign the edges or the body of the snake.

Have fun and Good Luck.
